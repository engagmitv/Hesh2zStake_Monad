Project #6 â€“ Hesh Staking Contract (Owner + User Testing)

This is my 6th smart contract on Monad Testnet â€” a complete staking system (Hesh2Stake) built to contribute to the growing Monad ecosystem.

All functions were deployed and tested using both the owner wallet and a secondary user wallet, directly through Remix + OpenZeppelin integration.

âœ… Actions completed:

Deployed ERC20 token (Hesh2z) and staking contract (Hesh2Stake) via OpenZeppelin + Remix.

Tested all contract functions successfully.

Connected a secondary wallet to simulate real user staking.

Executed stake() with 100,000 HESH2Z from the user wallet.

Executed claimRewards() successfully â€” confirmed on-chain via Remix.

Verified admin-only functions like setRewardRate() and withdraw() exclusively from the main owner wallet, ensuring proper access control.

Although I was not eligible for the airdrop, I truly believe in the Monad project and continue contributing to its ecosystem with real development work.

This is my 6th verified project, and I hope it helps me earn the Developer Role.
